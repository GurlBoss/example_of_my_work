# Example_of_my_work
This repository showcases a collection of challenging and well-crafted code samples. Its main objective is to demonstrate my coding style and thought processes.


## Finished
Inside the "finished" folder, you can find completed assignments from university and work-interview tasks.

## Experimental
The "experimental" section includes code examples related to training the LSTM model. Please note that these codes are not fully executable without some additional files. Feel free to ask me for more information if needed.
