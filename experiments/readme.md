# LSTM timeseries prediction
 
The code represent the experiments with the 2 models of LSTM network trying to forecast the timeseries.

## How to run

Create the venv with the all `requirements.txt` - they are not all necessary, since it's venv for other projects


Set up the values of the training in the `settings.txt`

Run with `python train.py`

Set up the weights in `test.py`

Set up the csv file in `visualise.py`

Get the visualisation of prediction with:
`python visualise.py`
